}
\arguments{
\item{connection}{A connection to the server containing the schema as created using the
\code{connect} function in the \code{DatabaseConnector} package.}

\item{oracleTempSchema}{A schema where temp tables can be created in Oracle.}

\item{cdmDatabaseSchema}{The name of the database schema that contains the OMOP CDM instance.
Requires read permissions to this database. On SQL Server, this should
specifiy both the database and the schema, so for example
'cdm_instance.dbo'.}

\item{cohortTable}{Name of the table holding the cohort for which we want to construct
covariates. If it is a temp table, the name should have a hash prefix,
e.g. '#temp_table'. If it is a non-temp table, it should include the
database schema, e.g. 'cdm_database.cohort'.}

\item{cohortId}{For which cohort ID should covariates be constructed? If set to -1,
covariates will be constructed for all cohorts in the specified cohort
table.}

\item{cdmVersion}{The version of the Common Data Model used. Currently only
\code{cdmVersion = "5"} is supported.}

\item{rowIdField}{The name of the field in the cohort temp table that is to be used as the
row_id field in the output table. This can be especially usefull if there
is more than one period per person.}

\item{covariateSettings}{An object created using the \code{createSubgroupCovariateSettings} function.}

\item{aggregated}{Should aggregate statistics be computed instead of covariates per
cohort entry?}
